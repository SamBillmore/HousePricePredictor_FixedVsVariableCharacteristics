# HousePricePredictor_FixedVsVariableCharacteristics

A fun project based on a Kaggle data set for estimating the potential profit to be made from renovations and improvements.

The code is held in the Jupyter Notebook, along with commentary about my approach and thought process when completing the project. The code can be run from the Jupyter Notebook without any changes or adaptions, as long as the data has been downloaded from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and stored in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook with the filename `housing.csv`.
